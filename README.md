Let us help you guide through the landscape of knowledge for Shopware 6. This documentation is organised in order to facilitate knowledge for different **products**, **topics** and **depths** of interest.

The Shopware 6 documentation is your main hub to gather knowledge in order to develop extensions and themes. Make sure to take a look at the How-Tos after you've set up your development environment and visit the [academy](https://academy.shopware.com/collections?category=developer-sw6) for video content. If you have any questions left, you can always ask them on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=shopware) or join our awesome community on [Slack](https://slack.shopware.com/).
