# Extensions

In order to provide users \(i.e. developers\) with a clear abstraction, Shopware consists of a core which designed in a way that allows for a lot of **extensibility** without sacrificing maintainability or structural integrity. Some of those concepts were already introduced in the [Frameworks](../framework/) section. However, the main domain for extensions \(that leverage those very concepts\) are [**Apps**](apps.md) and [**Plugins**](plugins.md). The following section will discuss what they can be used for and what the differences are.
