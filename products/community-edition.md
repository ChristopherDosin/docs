# Community Edition

The **Community Edition** is the open source, basic variant of Shopware which is free for everyone to use. All other Shopware editions, such as [Professional](professional-edition.md), [Enterprise](enterprise-edition.md) and [Cloud](cloud-1.md). Are based upon the Community Edition.

You can host it on your own server and develop plugins, themes and apps to customise it.
